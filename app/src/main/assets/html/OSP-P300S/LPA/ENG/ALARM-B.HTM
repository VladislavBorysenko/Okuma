       X=1-&gt;Internal error
       The SVP has caused any of parity error, loop error and
       protect error.
         YY:Internal error status
         ZZZZ:Two high-order bytes of the SVP system address in
              trouble
       X=2-&gt;Time out
       The SVP does not send any response within 20s at the time
       of start up. Minute investigation should be made to locate
       the cause.
       Since the SVP cannot detect the start up signal, it cannot
       execute the start up sequence.
         YY=00
         ZZZZ=0000
       X=3-&gt;Double bus error
       During bus error exception processing by SVP, a bus error
       has occurred again. The SVP hardware will probably be 
       defective.
         YY:SVP status
         ZZZZ=0000
       X=4SVP command execution
       The SVP has obtained wrong diagnostic results of CPU
       command execution. The CPU will probably be defective.

       Please release the Collision Avoidance function by 
       switching off (CAS parameter or M instruction) when you

       However, interference is not detected in that case and 
       drive, please after it confirms it enough.
       In case of code=12, After it is confirmed not to interfere, 
       bit 2 of NC optional parameter bit No.62 is set to &quot;1&quot;. 
       The NC program can be executed without correcting 
       the NC program because alarm B becomes alarm D.

       This alarm occurs if the change per unit time exceeds

       feedrate is abnormally high compared with the normal
       rapid feedrate, or the encoder value changes irregularly

       By a sub spindle machine, spindle mode was changed in C axis
       connection control.
       Concerning new LT control, R Main spindle side was selection
       on the side of B Turret.

        1-&gt;With pickoff spindle, the G code other than G140 is
           designated for the G13 (A-turret) side in the G142 mode.
        2-&gt;The spindle mode is switched in the C-axis control mode.
        3-&gt;The spindle mode is switched in the flat turning mode.
        4-&gt;G141 command is designated on B turret of the machine
       	with sub-spindle.
        5-&gt;In the LT model, sequence restart of the spindle is
           designated in the other spindle operation mode.
        6-&gt;In the LT model, when there was saddle of one side on M02
           instruction receipt conditions, another saddle performed
           spindle mode changing. Or,when there was saddle of one side
           on a synchronism standby condition of spindle mode changing
           instruction, another saddle accepted M02 instructions.
        7-&gt;By LT machine, a saddle of one side under M100 command
           receipt condition was changed by another saddle.
           Or, a saddle of one side received M100 command under
           a synchronous waiting condition of spindle mode
           change command.
        8-&gt;By the machine with Y-axis,G141 command was designated
           in Y axis mode.
       11-&gt;The exchange instruction of the main spindle mode was
           executed on X-axis mirror image coordinate system.
       13-&gt;When tool retraction interruption mode,
           G140/G141 command was ordered.
       14-&gt;Concerning Sub spindle-tailstock Control specification, 
           G141 command was designated at 'tailstock mode'.
